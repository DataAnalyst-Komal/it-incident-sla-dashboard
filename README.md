## IT Incident & SLA Performance Dashboard

This project analyzes IT incident data and SLA performance to identify operational inefficiencies and improvement opportunities. Built entirely as a self-initiated portfolio project using a Kaggle dataset, it applies 5 years of IT Service Management experience through a data analytics lens.

## Objective

To understand incident patterns, identify root causes, and evaluate SLA performance across departments, priorities, and locations — translating operational knowledge into KPI-driven insights that leadership can act on.

## Tech Stack

Power BI — Dashboard design, data visualization & interactive reporting
Power Query — Data cleaning & transformation
DAX — Calculated columns & measures

## Dataset

Source: Kaggle (publicly available IT incident dataset)

## KPI

Total Incidents- 1,200 
Breached Incidents- 873
SLA Breached %- 72.75%
Critical Incidents- 320

## Key Insights

-72.75% overall SLA breach rate — indicates significant performance gaps in incident resolution efficiency.
-Critical incidents breach SLA at 95.88% — averaging ~35 hrs against a 1–4 hr target, nearly 9x over SLA.
-High priority at 89.20% breach rate — against a 4–8 hr target, still significantly over acceptable thresholds
-IT Support handles the highest volume (268) and highest SLA breach rate (74.63%)
-Security & Server issues drive the majority of High (324) and Critical (320) priority incidents
-Medium & Low priority incidents remain comfortably within SLA — confirming this is a P1/P2 escalation problem, not a capacity problem
-October–November shows peak SLA breaches, indicating possible seasonal operational strain
-Remote Site 1 reports the highest number of incidents (276)

** Not all SLA breaches are avoidable — major outages, resource constraints, and unforeseen incidents are unavoidable operational realities. However, a 95.88% Critical breach rate signals a systemic escalation gap beyond acceptable thresholds.**

## SLA Performance by Priority

Priority  Avg_Resolution SLA_Target Status
Critical  34.6 hrs       1–4 hrs    Breaching ~9x
High      35.2 hrs       4–8 hrs    Breaching ~5x
Medium    38.3 hrs       24–48 hrs  Within SLA
Low       36.1 hrs       3–5 days   Within SLA

## Dashboard Features

-SLA compliance tracking across departments, priorities and locations
-Incident trend analysis over time (monthly & quarterly)
-Priority-wise breakdown of incidents and SLA breach %
-Department-wise performance comparison
-Root cause analysis via treemap visualization
-Interactive filters — SLA Status, Priority, Month, Quarter, Root Cause

## Recommendations

-Implement a dedicated P1/P2 escalation queue — separate Critical & High incidents into a fast-track resolution workflow with dedicated resources.
-Set up automated SLA breach alerts — triggers notifications when Critical incidents exceed 2 hrs without resolution updates.
-Investigate October–November spike — assess whether staffing levels, change freeze periods, or seasonal factors contribute to the breach peak.
-Review IT Support workload distribution — highest volume AND highest breach rate suggests understaffing or skill gap.
-Introduce real-time SLA dashboards for team leads — visibility into live breach risk enables proactive intervention before SLA is missed.
-Root cause focus on Security & Server — targeted preventive measures for top incident drivers could significantly reduce High/Critical volumes.

## Business Impact

-Identifies P1/P2 escalation gaps where Critical incidents average ~9x over SLA target
-Supports prioritization of high-risk incident categories (Security & Server)
-Improves visibility into SLA performance across teams and locations
-Enables better resource allocation by distinguishing escalation problems from capacity problems
-Provides seasonal trend insight for proactive operational planning
